# Open source toolchain for building hardware products

Building physical products is hard.
One of the main reasons for hardware being hard is that the tools that are most commonly used are out of reach for someone who is just starting out. It could be SolidWorks, Altium, Ansys, Keil/IAR, and many more.
So how do you learn by building?! FOSS of course!

In this wiki, we are documenting the process of building a hardware product by only using FOSS tools. 

This wiki is probably not the best place to discuss feature parity between FOSS tools and their paid alternatives. This wiki also aims to be opinioinateds i.e. we don't want to talk about all the possible FOSS tools in this wiki. Only the ones that the contributors have used and recommend.


1. EDA
2. CAD
3. Firmware
4. Graphic design
5. Simulation & rendering
